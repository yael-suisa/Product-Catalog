Environment Variables

Environment Variables
Since this project uses MongoDB, the .env file is not included in the repository for security reasons. 

Live Demo
Screenshots of the required pages have been included, and Iâ€™d be happy to present the project live upon request.

Notes
Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the server.

For any issues, feel free to contact me.

Enjoy! ðŸš€
